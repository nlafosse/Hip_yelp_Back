Error: psql: error: FATAL: Peer authentication failed for user "postgres" Solution:

Run psql Run SHOW hba_file; Copy the path it returns (something like /etc/postgresql/13/main/pg_hba.conf on Ubuntu) Open pg_hba.conf in a text editor (you will likely need to run the command with sudo) Change this line: local all postgres peer to: local all postgres md5 Restart PostgreSQL: sudo service postgresql restart Now rerun the original command
